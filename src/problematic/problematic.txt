This directory ("rhe2/src/problematic") is for program source code in compiled languages (such as C and C++) which I originally wrote circa 2000-2014 for the DJGPP platform. These programs are "problematic" in that they will not work on my modern computers within substantial alteration because of difference in operating system (Linux or Cygwin vs Microsoft Windows), programming platform (Linux or Cygwin vs DJGPP), and character encoding (UTF-8 vs ASCII).
