(As for why the pointer is named "Patris", other than the fact that
that's Latin for "Father", I don't remember. I wrote that decades
ago as a demo of the relationships between pointers and arrays.
It could be worse; I could have called it "Filii", or even
"Spiritus_Sancti". And I'm not even a Catholic. Or Christian.
Or even religious. I just sometimes use bizarre variable names
just to mess with people's heads. For example, when I'm writing
in C++, instead of "argc" and "argv", I usually use "Beren" and
"Luthien". LOTR is a better book than The Bible anyway.)
