The code above comes almost directly from the math function, so yes,
it's slow but that's not a surprise for that reason.  I discovered
that math function last year.  While I've talked to mathematicians
from leading researchers on prime numbers to people who argue with me
on math newsgroups, they seem quite content with it not being
published.  I think part of the problem is that I've also worked on
finding a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and people seem to
think that means you must be a nut.  Besides which I have made a lot
of posts that might seem nutty, but that to me just gives an excuse,
as the information is important, not the discoverer, even if he is
nutty.  My work can be found at

which is called that because I'm an amateur with math discoveries who
has discovered the current mathematics system, which looks to me to be
to exclude outsiders, no matter what they discover.

You will also find the math function that the code above implements.

Yup, I discovered it early last year, and mathematicians gave me
misery for my troubles, when they bothered to pay much attention at
all.
