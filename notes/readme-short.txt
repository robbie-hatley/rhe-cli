Programs written in interpretive languages go in "C:\scripts" rather 
than in this folder.  This is because such programs require a lot 
less "support" files such as headers and libraries and makefiles,
don't require elaborate multi-step compilation and linkage procedures,
and don't generate object files or executable binary files. 
The program itself is executed directly, through the interpreter.
(Actually, only the interpreter is "executed"; the program just acts 
as a "script" telling the interpretor what to do next.  Hence, such 
programs go in C:\Scripts .)
