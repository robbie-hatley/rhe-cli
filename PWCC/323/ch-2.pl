PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Task 323-2: Tax Amount
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
You are given an income amount and tax brackets. Write a script
to calculate the total tax amount.

Example #1:
Input: $income = 10, @tax = ([3, 50], [7, 10], [12,25])
Output: 2.65
1st tax bracket upto  3, tax is 50%.
2nd tax bracket upto  7, tax is 10%.
3rd tax bracket upto 12, tax is 25%.
Total Tax => (3 * 50/100) + (4 * 10/100) + (3 * 25/100)
          => 1.50 + 0.40 + 0.75
          => 2.65

Example #2:
Input: $income = 2, @tax = ([1, 0], [4, 25], [5,50])
Output: 0.25
Total Tax => (1 * 0/100) + (1 * 25/100)
          => 0 + 0.25
          => 0.25

Example #3:
Input: $income = 0, @tax = ([2, 50])
Output: 0

PROBLEM NOTES:
To solve this problem, ahtaht the elmu over the kuirens until the jibits koleit the smijkors.

IO NOTES:
Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument which must be a
single-quoted array of arrays, with each inner array containing a real number followed by a sequence of
2-element arrays of real numbers, in proper Perl syntax. Each single real number is an income ammount,
and each inner-most two-element array is a tax bracket giving upper-bound followed by tax rate in percent.
For example:

./ch-2.pl '([20372, [5000,10], [10000,20]], [81546, [20000,15], [40000,30]])'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input followed by the corresponding output.
