PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Task 343-2: Champion Team
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
You have n teams in a tournament. A matrix grid tells you which
team is stronger between any two teams:
If grid[i][j] == 1, then team i is stronger than team j
If grid[i][j] == 0, then team j is stronger than team i
Find the champion team - the one with most wins, or if there is
no single such team, the strongest of the teams with most wins.
(You may assume that there is a definite answer.)

Example #1:
Input:           [0, 1, 1],
                 [0, 0, 1],
                 [0, 0, 0],
Expected output: Team 0

Example #2:
Input:           [0, 1, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 1, 0],
Expected output: Team 3

Example #3:
Input:           [0, 1, 0, 1],
                 [0, 0, 1, 1],
                 [1, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 1, 0],
Expected output: Team 0

Example #4:
Input:           [0, 1, 1],
                 [0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 1, 0],
Expected output: Team 0

Example #5:
Input:           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
Expected output: Team 2

PROBLEM NOTES:
Note: Even though the description says "You may assume that there is a definite answer.", that's just not so.
For example, there may be three teams with maximum number of wins each, with A beating B, B beating C, and
C beating A. That would be a tie. So as tie-breaker, I'll give rapidly-increasing bonuses for beating higher-
ranking teams. I'll start my making an array @w of wins. Then I'll make an array @s of scores with each team's
score being its number of wins plus a bonus for each team beaten consisting of one billionth times w**w
where w is the number-of-wins of the beaten team. For example, if a team beats one rank 2 team, one rank 3
team, and one rank 4 team, then its score will be (3 + 1E-9*2**2 + 1E-9*3**3 + 1E-9*4**4). Finally, I'll
return the index of the first team found with max score. (Thus team order is ultimate tie breaker.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IO NOTES:
Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument which must be a
single-quoted array of arrays of arrays of ones and zeros, in proper Perl syntax, like so:

./ch-2.pl '([[1,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,0],],[[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]])'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input followed by the corresponding output.
