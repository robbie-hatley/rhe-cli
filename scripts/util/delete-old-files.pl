# delete-old-files.pl
# Deletes all regular files in the current directory (and all subdirectories if a -r or --recurse option is
# used) which were modified more than a given time (in days) ago (default is 365.2422 days).
#
# This program skips all directory entries with names "." or ".." or suffixes "*.db", "*.ini", and "*.jbf",
# all names which don't point to something that exists, and all files which are directories or link or aren't
# regular files. If any regexps are given, this program also skips all files with names that don't match at
# least one of those regexps.
#
# Edit history:
# Thu Apr 01, 2021: Wrote first draft.
# Fri Apr 02, 2021: Made maximum age user-specifiable, and made regexps require delimiters so that qr options
#                   can be used. Also cleaned-up some comments and formatting.
# Thu Jun 24, 2021: Changed default age to 365.2422 days and added clarifying comments to curfile($).
# Tue Nov 16, 2021: Now using common::sense, and now using extended regexp sequences instead of delimiters.
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate; using "Sys::Binmode".
# Fri Dec 03, 2021: Now using just 1 regexp. (Use alternation instead of multiple regexps.)
# Thu Aug 15, 2024: Narrowed from 120 to 110; upgraded from "v5.32" to "v5.36"; restructured all prototypes;
#                   added signatures to all subroutines; got rid of unnecessary "use" statements;
#                   got rid of "$Db"; changed simulation option from "-e"/"--emulate "to "-s"/"--simulate".
# Wed Feb 26, 2025: Trimmed horizontal dividers.
# Tue Mar 04, 2025: Got rid of all prototypes and empty sigs.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Intro:
   Welcome to "delete-old-files.pl", Robbie Hatley's old-file-deletion program.
   Deletes all files in the current directory (and all subdirectories, if a -r or
   --recurse option is used) which were modified more than a given time ago in
   days. (The default age limit is 365.2422 days.)

   This program skips all nonexistent, hidden, meta (suffixes ".db", ".ini",
   ".jbf"), and non-regular files.

   If a regular expression is given as this program's sole argument, this program
   also skips all files which don't match that regular expression.

   This program should not be run frivolously, because it can permanently delete
   a large number of files all at once. Hence it prompts the user "ARE YOU SURE
   THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO DO???" unless in simulation or no-prompt
   mode.

   Command line:
   delete-old-files.pl [options] [arguments]

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Description of options:
   Option:                  Meaning:
   "-h" or "--help"         Print this help and exit.
   "-s" or "--simulate"     Merely simulate renames.
   "-l" or "--local"        DON'T recurse subdirectories. (default)
   "-r" or "--recurse"      DO recurse subdirectories.
   "-y" or "--yes"          Delete all old files without prompting.
   "--age=###"              Set max age (where "###" is any positive real number)
   Defaults are: no help, no simulate, no recurse, no yes, age = "365.2422 days".
   Multiple single-letter options may be piled after a single hyphen. Eg, "-yr".
   All other options are ignored.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Description of arguments:
   In addition to options, this program can take one optional argument which, if
   present, must be a Perl-Compliant Regular Expression specifying which items to
   process. To specify multiple patterns, use the | alternation operator.
   To apply pattern modifier letters, use an Extended RegExp Sequence.
   For example, if you want to search for items with names containing "cat",
   "dog", or "horse", title-cased or not, you could use this regexp:
   '(?i:c)at|(?i:d)og|(?i:h)orse'

   Be sure to enclose your regexp in 'single quotes', else BASH may replace it
   with matching names of entities in the current directory and send THOSE to
   this program, whereas this program needs the raw regexp instead.

   If the number of arguments is not 0 or 1, this program will print error
   and help messages and exit.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Example program invocation:
   To delete all files with "cat", "dog", or "horse" (title-cased or not) in
   their names, in any subdirectory, which are older than 275 days, type this:
   delete-old-files.pl -ry --age=275 '(?i:c)at|(?i:d)og|(?i:h)orse'

   Happy old-file deleting!
   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
