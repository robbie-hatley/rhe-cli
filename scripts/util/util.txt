This directory ("/d/rhe-cli/scripts/util") is for utility programs
(primarily for working with files, directories, text, times, and dates)
written in interpreted languages such as Perl, Python, Bash, Sed, Awk,
and are intended to be run via the Bash shell.

Most of these programs will run in Linux only and will NOT run in Cygwin,
due to their reliance on CPAN modules "utf8::all" and "Cwd::utf8". I use
those two modules because they allow dramatic simplification of the
handling of Unicode and UTF-8. The trade-off is that those two modules
don't work in Cygwin, so neither do these scripts. But that's fine,
because as of the time I'm writing this (Friday December 26 2025),
Microsoft Windows is a dying operating system. Windows 10 is no-longer
supported and Windows 11 won't run on most computers, and both OSs have
all of the bad baggage that goes along with Microsoft Windows (frequent
crashes, forced updates, forced log-in to Microsoft accounts, etc).
So I now do nearly all of my computing using Linux, and so should you.
