This folder ("/d/rhe-cli/scripts/util") is for utility programs written in
interpretive languages such as Sed, Awk, Perl, Python, Bash, etc, and
intended to be run via BASH. The programs in this directory are primarily
for working with files, directories, text, times, and dates. Programs
pertaining to other subjects are best put elsewhere. For example:

  1. Put "filter"   programs in "/d/rhe-cli/scripts/filters".
  2. Put "fractal"  programs in "/d/rhe-cli/scripts/fractals".
  3. Put "math"     programs in "/d/rhe-cli/scripts/math".
  4. Put "science"  programs in "/d/rhe-cli/scripts/science".
  5. Put compiled binary executables in "/d/rhe-bin".
  6. Put source code written in compiled languages in subdirectories of
     "/d/rhe-cli/src".

Those are just examples, but that gives the general idea.
