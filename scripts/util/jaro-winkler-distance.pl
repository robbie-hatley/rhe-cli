The Weekly Challenge 010-2, "Jaro-Winkler distance".
Solution in Perl by Robbie Hatley, written Thu Aug 29, 2024.

simj = 0==m ? 0
            : (1/3)*(m/l1 + m/l2 + (m-t)/m)

simw = simj+lp(1-simj)
     = simj*(1-lp)+lp

dw   = 1 - simw

Where:

"dw" = Jaro-Winkler Distance

"simw" = Jaro-Winkler Similarity

"lp" = one tenth of the number of the first 5 characters which match from the beginning.
For example, "wordiness" and "wordsworth" have an lp of "0.4", whereas "sword" and "sward"
only have an lp of "0.2". (The "rd" doesn't count, because the match starts at the beginning
and ends before the first non-matching character.)

"simj" = Jaro Similarity, which is 0 if m=0 else (1/3)*(m/l1 + m/l2 + (m-t)/m)

"m" = Number of matching characters within a distance of floor(max(l1,l2)/2)-1;
any one character of string1 or string2 may be counted as a "match" only once,
and a match at zero distance should be preferred over a match at non-zero distance.

"t" is one half of the number of characters which match in the wrong order (index
order in string2 opposite of index order in string1).

"l1" is the length of string1.

"l2" is the length of string2.

   Welcome to Robbie Hatley's "Jaro-Winkler Distance" program.
   This program takes exactly two arguments, which are strings
   to be compared, and will print the following similarity metrics
   for the given pair of strings:
   1. Prefix similarity.
   2. Number of matching characters.
   3. Number of transpositions.
   4. Jaro similarity.
   5. Jaro distance.
   6. Jaro-Winkler Similarity.
   7. Jaro-Winkler Distance.

   Happy string-pair comparing!

   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
