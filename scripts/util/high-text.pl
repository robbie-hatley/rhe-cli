# Generates 100,000 characters of text with random Unicode ordinals in the 0-40959 range ("Null" through

# piping. Hence, I'm using "utf8::all". The purpose of this script is to test the ability of programs to deal
# with a wide range of multilingual Unicode characters, including control characters, Latin-variant
# characters, ideographic characters, etc.
