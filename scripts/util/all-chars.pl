# Generates 40,960 characters of text with sequential Unicode ordinals in the 0-40959 range ("Null" through
# "x√¨ng"). This is nearly every single commonly-used character in Unicode! This script then converts those
# characters into UTF-8 for printing and/or storing in a file and/or piping. Hence, I'm using "utf8::all".
#
# The purpose of this script is to generate a chart of all commonly-used characters, to see what they look
# like.
