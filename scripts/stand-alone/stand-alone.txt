This directory is for sharable Perl scripts which do not make
make any use of my "RH::xxxx" modules, contain whatever
proprietary code they need within themselves, and call only
commonly-used CPAN modules ("Scalar::Util", "List::Util", etc).
These scripts are thus "stand-alone" in that one doesn't need
to download or install anything else to use them; just put the
scripts in a location in $PATH and evoke them by name and they
just work.
