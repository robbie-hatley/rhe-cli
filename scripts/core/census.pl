# /rhe/scripts/util/census.pl
# Robbie Hatley's nifty file-system census utility. Prints how many files and bytes are in the current
# directory and each of its subdirectories.
# Written by Robbie Hatley.
# Edit history:
# Fri May 08, 2015: Wrote first draft.
# Thu Jul 09, 2015: Various minor improvements.
# Fri Jul 17, 2015: Upgraded for utf8.
# Sat Apr 16, 2016: Now using -CSDA.
# Sun Sep 20, 2020: Corrected errors in Help.
# Mon Sep 21, 2020: Corrected more errors in Help, increased width to 97, changed "--atleast="
#                   to "--files=", added "--gb=", improved comments and formatting, and now
#                   ANDing "--gb=" and "--files=" together.
# Wed Feb 17, 2021: Refactored to use the new GetFiles(), which now requires a fully-qualified directory as
#                   its first argument, target as second, and regexp (instead of wildcard) as third.
# Wed Nov 17, 2021: Added "use common::sense;", shortened sub names, added comments, corrected errors in help,
#                   wrapped regexp in qr//, refactored argv(), added sub dirstats(), and unscrambled the logic
#                   in curdire().
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate; using "common::sense" and
#                   "Sys::Binmode".
# Mon Sep 04, 2023: Upgraded from "v5.32" to "v5.36". Got rid of "common::sense" (antiquated). Got rid of all
#                   prototypes. Now using signatures. Reduced width from 120 to 110. Removed '/o' from all
#                   qr(). Added debug, quiet, verbose, local, recurse options. Entry/stats/exit messages are
#                   now printed only if being verbose. Entry/stats/exit are to STDERR and header and dir info
#                   are to STDOUT. $direcount, $filecount, and $gigacount now count only directories and files
#                   which obey the restrictions imposed by $RegExp, $Empty, $GB, and $Files. Improved help.
# Wed Aug 14, 2024: Removed unnecessary "use" statements.
# Tue Mar 04, 2025: Added comments to subroutine predeclarations.
# Fri May 02, 2025: Now using "utf8::all" and "Cwd::utf8". Simplified shebang to "#!/usr/bin/env perl".
#                   Nixed all "d", "e".
# Tue May 06, 2025: Reverted to "-C63", "utf8", "Cwd", "d", "e", for Cygwin compatibility.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Introduction:

   Welcome to "census.pl", Robbie Hatley's nifty directory-tree census utility.
   This program prints how many files are in the current directory and each of its
   subdirectories, and how many gigabytes of storage space they use.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Command lines:

   census.pl -h | --help        (to print this help and exit)
   census.pl [options] [Arg]    (to tally files & gigabytes in directories)

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Description of options:

   Option:            Meaning:
   -h or --help       Print help and exit.
   -d or --debug      Print diagnostics.
   -q or --quiet      Don't print     entry/exit/stats messages.         (DEFAULT)
   -t or --terse      Print limited   entry/exit/stats messages.
   -v or --verbose    Prtnt exuberant entry/exit/stats messages.
   -l or --local      Don't recurse subdirectories.                      (DEFAULT)
   -r or --recurse    Do    recurse subdirectories.
   -e or --empty      Only display directories containing 0 regular files.
   --files=####       Only display directories containing at least ####
                      files, where #### is any non-negative integer.
   --gb=##            Only display directories containing at least ##
                      gigabytes, where ## is any non-negative integer.
         --           End of options (all further CL items are arguments).

   "-e" overrides "gb=" and/or "files=" and prints info ONLY on directories
   which are empty.

   If both "--gb=" and "--files=" are BOTH used, they are logically ANDed
   together. So if you command "census.pl --gb=1.3 --files=500", then
   census.pl will print info on any directories which contain both
   1.3GB-or-more of content AND 500+ files.

   If "-e|--empty", "--gb=", or "--files=" are NOT used, then this program prints
   info on ALL directories in the directory tree descending from the cwd.

   Multiple single-letter options may be piled-up after a single hyphen. For
   example, use -dl to print diagnostics and process the current directory
   only.

   If you want to use an argument that looks like an option (say, you want to
   process only files which contain "--recurse" as part of their name), use a "--"
   option; that will force all command-line entries to its right to be considered
   "arguments" rather than "options".

   All options not listed above are ignored.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Description of Arguments:

   In addition to options, this program can take 1 or 2 optional arguments.

   Arg1 (OPTIONAL), if present, must be a Perl-Compliant Regular Expression
   specifying which file names to process. To specify multiple patterns, use the
   | alternation operator. To apply pattern modifier letters, use an Extended
   RegExp Sequence. For example, if you want to process items with names
   containing "cat", "dog", or "horse", title-cased or not, you could use this
   regexp: '(?i:c)at|(?i:d)og|(?i:h)orse'
   Be sure to enclose your regexp in 'single quotes', else BASH may replace it
   with matching names of entities in the current directory and send THOSE to
   this program, whereas this program needs the raw regexp instead.

   Arg2 (OPTIONAL), if present, must be a boolean predicate using Perl
   file-test operators. The expression must be enclosed in parentheses (else
   this program will confuse your file-test operators for options), and then
   enclosed in single quotes (else the shell won't pass your expression to this
   program intact). Here are some examples of valid and invalid predicate arguments:
   '(-d && -l)'  # VALID:   Finds symbolic links to directories
   '(-l && !-d)' # VALID:   Finds symbolic links to non-directories
   '(-b)'        # VALID:   Finds block special files
   '(-c)'        # VALID:   Finds character special files
   '(-S || -p)'  # VALID:   Finds sockets and pipes.  (S must be CAPITAL S   )
    '-d && -l'   # INVALID: missing parentheses       (confuses program      )
    (-d && -l)   # INVALID: missing quotes            (confuses shell        )
     -d && -l    # INVALID: missing parens AND quotes (confuses prgrm & shell)

   Arguments and options may be freely mixed, but the arguments must appear in
   the order Arg1, Arg2 (RegExp first, then File-Type Predicate); if you get them
   backwards, they won't do what you want, as most predicates aren't valid regexps
   and vice-versa.

   NOTE: You can't "skip" Arg1 and go straight to Arg2 because your intended Arg2
   would be construed as Arg1! But you can "bypass" Arg1 by using '.+' meaning
   "some characters" which will match every file name.

   A number of arguments greater than 2 will cause this program to print an error
   message and abort.

   Happy directory storage-space-usage reporting!
   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
