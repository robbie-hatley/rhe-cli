The scripts in "/d/rhe-cli/scripts/core" are core utility scripts which
ARE essential core utilities, and are primarily intended to process incoming
files, rather than massage existing data (or do other things altogether).
These programs all run fine in both Linux and Cygwin, due to having
"#!/usr/bin/env -S perl -C63" shebangs and NOT being reliant on CPAN modules
"utf8::all" or "Cwd::utf8".

(For auxiliary utilities intended mainly for massaging existing data, and
doing other things, see my "util" collection; those scripts work ONLY on Linux
due to having "#!/usr/bin/env perl" shebangs and being reliant on CPAN modules
"utf8::all" and "Cwd::utf8".)
