This directory ("/d/rhe-cli/scripts/filters/") is for programs which
take-in text on STDIN, process it, and print output based on that input
to STDOUT. This facilitates use in pipe streams on the BASH command-line
("cat test.txt | prog1 | prog2 | prog3"), with the programs of the pipe
stream acting as "filters" which typically (but not necessarily) remove
specific elements from the stream and pass-on the remainder. These
programs are mostly written in Sed, Awk, and Perl.
