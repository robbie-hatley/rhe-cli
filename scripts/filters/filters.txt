This directory ("/d/rhe-cli/scripts/filters/") is for programs which take-in text on STDIN, process it, and print output based on that input to STDOUT. This facilitates use in pipe streams on the BASH command-line ("cat test.txt | prog1 | prog2 | prog3"), with the programs of the pipe stream acting as "filters" which typically (but not necessarily) remove specific elements from the stream and pass-on the remainder. These programs are mostly Perl scripts based on "while (<>) {...}" loops.
